Self-Hosting

1. [Self-Hosting](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting)
3. [Overview](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting)

# Self-Hosting

## Install and run your own Supabase.

* * *

Self-hosted Supabase lets you run the entire Supabase stack on your own computer, server, or cloud infrastructure.

This is different from:

- **Supabase CLI / Local Development**: A lightweight [local environment](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development) for development and testing only.
- **Managed Supabase** platform: If you want to try managed Supabase for free, visit [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

Self-hosting is a good fit if you need full control over your data, have compliance requirements that prevent using managed services, or want to run Supabase in an isolated environment.

## No telemetry [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting\#no-telemetry)

Self-hosted Supabase does not phone home or collect any telemetry.

## Enterprise [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting\#enterprise)

If you're an enterprise using self-hosted Supabase, we'd love to hear from you. Reach out to our [Growth Team](https://forms.supabase.com/enterprise) to discuss your use case, share feedback, or explore design partnership opportunities.

## Officially supported [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting\#officially-supported)

## Community supported [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting\#community-supported)

There are several community-driven projects to help you deploy Supabase. These projects may be outdated and are seeking active maintainers. If you're interested in maintaining one of these projects, [contact the community team](https://supabase.com/open-source/contributing/supasquad).

[KubernetesMaintainer needed\\
\\

[TraefikMaintainer needed\\
\\

## Responsibility model [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting\#responsibility-model)

When you self-host, **you are responsible for**:

- Server provisioning and maintenance
- Security hardening and keeping OS and services updated
- Maintaining the Postgres database
- Backups and disaster recovery
- Monitoring and uptime
